###About the Project
This project is a part of the ALX Airbnb Database Module, where you will implement advanced SQL querying and optimization techniques to work with a simulated Airbnb database. By diving into real-world challenges like optimizing query performance, writing complex SQL scripts, and applying indexing and partitioning, participants will gain hands-on experience with database management and performance tuning. This ensures you are equipped to handle large-scale applications where efficiency and scalability are critical.
